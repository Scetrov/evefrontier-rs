# Project documentation

This directory contains user-facing documentation and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the
evefrontier-cli workspace.

Files

- `USAGE.md` — how to build, run and use the CLI and library.
- `CODING_GUIDELINES.md` — repository coding style expectations and control-flow preferences.
- `adrs/` — architecture decision records, written in the Nygard ADR style.

Use these docs as the single source of truth for usage, design rationale and important decisions
made while developing this project.
